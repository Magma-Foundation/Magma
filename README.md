# Magma Programming Language

Magma is a statically-typed, high-performance programming language with a strong orientation towards web development. Influenced by TypeScript and Rust, Magma seamlessly integrates functional and object-oriented programming paradigms while emphasizing safety, performance, and flexibility.

## Key Features

- **Statically Typed:** Magma offers a robust type system that ensures type safety and enables efficient compilation to WebAssembly.
- **Memory Safety:** Inspired by Rust's borrow checker, Magma provides mechanisms to ensure safe memory management and prevent data races.
- **Functional and Object-Oriented:** Magma supports both functional and object-oriented programming, allowing developers to express complex logic in an elegant and concise manner.
- **WebAssembly:** Magma compiles to WebAssembly, enabling high-performance web applications that run smoothly across different platforms.
- **Expressive Syntax:** Magma's syntax combines the best of TypeScript and Rust, offering a user-friendly and expressive language for professional web developers.
- **Error Handling:** Magma uses a 'Result' type and pattern matching for robust and graceful error handling.
